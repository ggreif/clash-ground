* How application is normally done

#+begin_src ditaa :file app.svg

          /--\
          |ap|
	  +--+
         /    \
        f      a

#+end_src

* Either of both sub-nodes can be a variable

so let's special case those!

 - app_tree_tree
 - app_v_tree
 - app_tree_v
 - app_v_v

* But we still need to store the vars, right?

With De Bruijn it is easier, but still...

Consider:

#+begin_src ditaa :file app.svg

          /--\
          |ap|
	  \--+
              \
        f?     a

#+end_src

How can we say which /f/ is meant?

Solution: store the De Bruijn index in the ap node but at the type level!

* The /app_v_v/ case

The first v has index 0, the second /n/. So we need flipped /app/: /ppa/
